This repository contains source code used for the McGill COMP550 Final Project. In this project, we studied in depth two state-of-the-art models for relation extraction - BERT-PAIR and REDN, and developed rigorous experiments to train the models and compare their performances across various domains of relation extraction tasks. 

Source code for model architectures was adapted from

- https://github.com/thunlp/FewRel for BERT-PAIR
- https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE/tree/master/opennre for REDN

The model checkpoints and datasets are not included in this repository.
